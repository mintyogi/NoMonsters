# NoMonsters
A Vintage Story mod that disables monsters

Want a more chill Vintage Story experience and or not enjoy life with bells, drifters, and locusts? Love the wonders of cave exploration without the stress? If so, the No Monsters mod is for you.

It prevents bells, drifters, and locusts from spawning. It does not affect any other entities so you can still enjoy the dangerous wolves!
